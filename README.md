I usually tell people that my major is like a mix of data analytics, statistics, and computer programing. I work at the dining center and three activities I have been doing there are washing dishes, cleaning tabels, and making sandwiches. Three tools I use for organizing my work are my weekly planner, keeping track of due dates, and getting stuff done early.
